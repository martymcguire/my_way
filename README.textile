h1. Sinatra Starter Kit

A starting point for your new Sinatra app. It loads you up with a Rails-ish directory structure with either a single or multiple controller files, models, views. It makes it easy to stay on top with the newest Sinatra-source. And it's ready to roll with RSpec and DataMapper.

h2. Configuration

Database config is in _config.rb_. Tests use the sqlite3-memory adapter, so no setup needed.

For models/multiple controller files and other stuff, take a look at _application.rb_

h2. Living on the edge

There's a Rake task for grabbing the latest Sinatra source from GitHub.

* rake sinatra:edge
